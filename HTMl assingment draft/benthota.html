                        The Bentota Turtle Hatchery in Sri Lanka is an important
                         conservation project dedicated to the protection and preservation of turtles.
                        Located in the town of Bentota, along the western coastline of Sri Lanka, 
                        the hatchery plays a crucial role in safeguarding turtle
                        eggs and rehabilitating injured turtles.

                <ul>
                    <li>One of the primary objectives of the hatchery is to protect turtle eggs 
                        from natural predators and human interference. Left on their own, turtle eggs 
                        face risks from predators and can be vulnerable to poaching. The hatchery provides a 
                        safe environment where the eggs can be incubated until they hatch, ensuring
                         a higher chance of survival for the hatchlings</li>
                    <li>In addition to protecting eggs, the Bentota Turtle Hatchery also focuses on the
                         rescue and rehabilitation of injured turtles. Turtles that have been injured at sea
                          due to factors such as fishing nets or boat motors are brought to the hatchery for 
                          treatment and care. Once the turtles have been rehabilitated, they are released back 
                          into their natural habitat, 
                        promoting their chances of surviva</li>
                    <li>The hatchery serves as an educational center, raising awareness
                         about the importance of turtle conservation and the need to protect these
                          magnificent creatures. Visitors to the Bentota Turtle Hatchery have the 
                          opportunity to learn about the different turtle species found in Sri Lanka's waters, 
                          including the impressive leatherback turtle 
                        and the beautiful hawksbill turtle</li>

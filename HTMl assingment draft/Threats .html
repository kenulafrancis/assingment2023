              <h1>Habitat Destruction and Coastal Development</h1>
              <br>
              <h2>Description:</h2>
              <p> One of the major threats to the turtle population 
                in Sri Lanka is habitat destruction due to coastal development. 
                The rapid expansion of tourism, urbanization, and infrastructure 
                projects along the coast has resulted in the destruction and
                 degradation of nesting beaches and feeding grounds for turtles.</p>
  
              <h2>Consequences:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Disruption of nesting habitats: Construction activities 
                  and human presence on beaches can scare away nesting turtles, 
                  leading to decreased nesting success and population decline.</li>
  
                <li>Loss of foraging areas: Coastal development often leads to the destruction
                   of seagrass beds and coral reefs, which are important feeding grounds for turtles.
                   This can lead to malnutrition and reduced reproductive success.</li>
              </ul>   
  
              <h2>Prevention:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Implement strict coastal development regulations to protect turtle habitats.</li>
                <li>Establish protected areas and marine reserves to safeguard nesting beaches and feeding grounds.</li>
                <li>Conduct environmental impact assessments for any coastal development projects.</li>
                <li>Encourage sustainable tourism practices that minimize disturbance to turtle habitats</li>
              </ul>

              <h1>Illegal Egg Collection and Poaching</h1>
              <h2>Description:</h2>
              <p>Illegal egg collection and poaching pose a significant threat to 
                turtle populations in Sri Lanka. Turtle eggs are often collected for 
                consumption or sold on the black market, 
                driven by demand for traditional medicines and culinary purposes.</p>
  
              <h2>Consequences:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Decreased hatchling survival: Egg collection disrupts the natural incubation process, reducing the chances of eggs hatching and surviving.</li>
                <li>Imbalanced sex ratios: Temperature-dependent sex determination in sea turtles means that the loss of eggs can skew the population towards one sex,
                   leading to reproductive imbalances.</li>
                <li>Population decline: Continuous illegal egg collection can lead to a significant decline in turtle populations over time</li>
              </ul>
  
              <h2>Prevention:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Strengthen law enforcement efforts to deter and apprehend egg collectors and poachers.</li>
                <li>Conduct awareness campaigns to educate local communities about the importance of turtle conservation and the negative impacts of egg collection.</li>
                <li>Establish community-based conservation programs that provide alternative livelihoods for those involved in egg collection.</li>
                <li>Promote sustainable alternative sources for traditional medicine and discourage the use of turtle eggs.</li>
              </ul>

              <h1> Pollution and Marine Debris</h1>
              <h2>Description:</h2>
              <p>Pollution, including plastic waste, oil spills, and chemical pollutants, 
                poses a significant threat to the turtle population in Sri Lanka. Turtles are 
                highly susceptible to ingesting or becoming entangled in marine debris, 
                which can result in injuries, diseases, or death.</p>
  
              <h2>Consequences:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Ingestion of plastic: Turtles often mistake plastic debris for food, leading to digestive blockages, malnutrition, and slow growth rates.</li>
                <li>Entanglement in fishing gear: Turtles can get entangled in discarded fishing nets and lines, causing injuries, amputations, or suffocation.</li>
                <li>Contamination from chemical pollutants: Chemicals, such as oil and pesticides, can contaminate water bodies and affect the health and reproductive capabilities of turtles.</li>
              </ul>
  
              <h2>Prevention:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Promote responsible waste management practices to reduce the amount of plastic and other debris entering the ocean.</li>
                <li>Conduct regular beach clean-up campaigns to remove litter from nesting and foraging areas.</li>
                <li>Implement stricter regulations and monitoring for industrial and commercial activities that release pollutants into marine environments.</li>
                <li>Encourage sustainable fishing practices that reduce the use of harmful gear and promote the proper disposal of fishing equipment.</li>
              </ul>

                        Sri Lanka is home to a vibrant population of turtles, with five different species found along its shores. These species include the Olive Ridley turtle, the Green turtle, the Leatherback turtle, the Loggerhead turtle, and the Hawksbill turtle. The beaches of Sri Lanka are among the most important nesting sites for turtles in the Indian Ocean, with thousands of turtles coming ashore every year to lay their eggs in the sand.

                    <p>Green turtles are the most commonly encountered sea
                         turtle species in Sri Lanka. They have a streamlined body
                          and can grow quite large. Green turtles are herbivorous, feeding primarily on 
                          seagrass and algae. They are known for their migratory behavior, often returning to the same
                           beaches where they were born to lay their eggs. Green turtles play a vital role in maintaining the health of
                         seagrass beds and are an important part of the marine ecosystem.

                    <p>Hawksbill turtles are named after their pointed beak, resembling that of a bird.
                         They have a unique and beautiful shell with intricate patterns. Hawksbills primarily feed 
                         on sponges but also consume other invertebrates. Due to the stunning appearance of their shells, 
                         they were historically hunted for the tortoiseshell trade, although this practice is now illegal. Hawksbill
                          turtles are critically endangered globally, and conservation efforts focus on protecting 
                        their nesting sites and raising awareness about their importance.</p>

                    <p>Olive Ridley turtles are the smallest and most abundant sea turtle species worldwide. 
                        They have a high-domed shell and a wide distribution, including Sri Lanka. Olive Ridleys 
                        exhibit an incredible nesting behavior called arribadas, where hundreds or even thousands 
                        of females gather to nest simultaneously. They are omnivorous, feeding on crustaceans, jellyfish, 
                        and small fish. Like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys face threats such as habitat loss, pollution, and 
                        accidental capture in fishing gear, emphasizing the need for conservation efforts.</p>

                    <p> Leatherback turtles are the largest of all sea turtle species and are unique because they lack a hard shell.
                         Instead, their carapace is covered with a thick, leathery skin. They have a more hydrodynamic body shape 
                         compared to other turtles, allowing them to dive to incredible depths. Leatherbacks have a diet consisting 
                         mainly of jellyfish. These turtles face various threats, including entanglement in fishing gear and ingestion 
                         of marine debris.Their conservation is crucial to protect their population and the balance of the marine ecosystem.</p>
